## How to contribute to pwch

### Found a bug?

Great! Here's what you can do:

* Please refer to the security policy if the bug you found is a security vulnerability in pwch.
* If it's one of those bugs which are annoying but not harmful, please follow these steps:

   * Look through existing issues. Chances are you are not the only person to encounter this bug.
   * Have you checked the closed ones as well?
   * If you are still reading this, time has come to open an issue. Please use the bug issue template when creating a new bug report.

* Should you already be working on a patch do not hesitate to open a pull request!

### Want a new fancy feature?

New ideas are always welcome! But please keep in mind that pwch is meant to be a simple application with a narrowly defined use case.
This means that not every feature request may result in an implementation. 

If you intend to implement a new feature yourself and open a pull request, I suggest you open an issue first to ensure it has a chance to get accepted. 

Anyways, please use the feature request template when opening an issue.
