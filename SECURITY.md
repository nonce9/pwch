## Reporting a Vulnerability

Either report a vulnerability privately [here](https://github.com/nonce9/pwch/security/advisories/new) (preferred)
or open a new issue and I will examine your report carefully.

* If your concern is accepted, I will try to fix it asap but PRs containing a patch are always welcome. 

* If reported privately, you may choose to be named as the original reporter. It's up to you.
